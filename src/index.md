# Hello there!
My name is Miles. I am a computer and math nerd, and an electric unicycle enthusiast! I love learning about how things work at a fundamental level, and as far as computers go, this translates to a fascination with lower-level computing.
I enjoy various subgenres of, but not limited to, metal, rock, hip-hop, and house with more in depth writings [here](./music.html).
I plan to post my guides and thoughts [here](./blogs.html), so stay tuned :)
